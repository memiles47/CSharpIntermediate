     * Design a class called Post. This class models a StackOverflow post. It should have properties
     * for title, description and the date/time it was created. We should be able to up-vote or down-vote
     * a post. We should also be able to see the current vote value. In the main method, create a post,
     * up-vote and down-vote it a few times and then display the current vote value.
     * In this exercise, you will lean that a StackOverflow post should provide methods for up-voting
     * and down-voting. You should not give the ability to set the Vote Property from the outside
     * because otherwise, you may accidentally change the votes of a class to 0 or to a random
     * number and this is how we create bugs in our programs. The class should always protect its
     * state and hide its implementation detail.
     * 
     * Issues:
     * 1) Correct location of created Post. Currently the scope of the created object is too limited
     * 2)
